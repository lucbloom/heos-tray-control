A Windows Notification Tray utility that lets me control my HEOS bar quickly.
- It saves the IP in a prefs file so it can start sending commands in 0s.
- It scans the network for HEOS devices on startup just to be sure.
- There is a "Set input to Optical In 1" button to quickly switch to my PC.
- There are play/pause/mute and volume up/down buttons

(Created with the help of ChatGPT for the boilerplate and HEOS API specifics)
